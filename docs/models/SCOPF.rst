Security constrained optimal power flow problem
================================================

Secure operation of a power system requires that no breach of oper-
ating standards take place following a credible contingency. This is
achieved by solved a security constrained optimal power flow. A DC
version of SCOPF is implemented in OATS. A set of credible contingencies can be specified in the test case. The credible contingencies
in OATS are outages of single circuits, transformers or generating units.
