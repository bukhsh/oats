Introduction to OATS
================================
Optimisation and Analysis Toolbox for power Systems (OATS) is a high-level modelling
and simulation tool for power system analysis, developed at the University of Strathclyde.
OATS is a collection of optimisation models and Python scripts for solving and analysing a
range of power system analysis problems. These problems include: load flow, optimal power flow (AC, DC and security constrained) and unit commitment. OATS can be extended to solve more bespoke problems such as balancing markets, multi-period, and stochastic optimsation.
