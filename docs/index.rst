Optimisation and Analysis Toolbox for power Systems (OATS) is a high-level modelling and simulation tool for power system analysis, developed at the University of Strathclyde.

OATS is a collection of optimisation models and Python scripts for analysis and solution of a range of power system analysis problems.



OATS integrates a modelling language PYOMO for describing optimisation models. Using PYOMOâ€™s high-level representation of sets, variables and parameters the models in OATS are written in a way that are intuitive and easy to understand and extend.
